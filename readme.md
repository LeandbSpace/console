# leanDB Console
leanDB Console is a third-party application for leanDB to execute leanDB query. 

leanDB Console is written in PHP, in future releases of leanDB we would include leanDB Console as a part of the leanDB core binary so 
it would be accessible without the dependency of PHP language. 

It's like *phpMyAdmin* for leanDB, where we can manage all our database and documents!
